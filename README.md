# Spontaneous Emergence of Agent Individuality Through Social Interactions in Large Language Model-Based Communities

Implementation code for the paper "Spontaneous Emergence of Agent Individuality Through Social Interactions in Large Language Model-Based Communities" by Ryosuke Takata, Atsushi Masumori, and Takashi Ikegami, published in Entropy (2024).

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains a simulation framework where multiple LLM-based agents interact in a 2D spatial environment. Agents can move, communicate with nearby agents, and maintain memories of their interactions. Through these social interactions, agents spontaneously develop individual characteristics and behaviors.

## 🔧 Prerequisites
1. Hugging Face Account (Required)
- Create an account at Hugging Face
- Request access to the Llama 2 model at meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
- Wait for approval (typically within 1-2 hours)

2. Hugging Face Access Token
- Go to Settings → Access Tokens
- Create a new token with read permissions
- Save the token securely

## 🚀 Running in Google Colab
Important: Make sure to connect to a GPU runtime before running the notebook.

Go to Runtime → Change runtime type
Select GPU as the Hardware accelerator (T4 or higher recommended)
Click Save and connect to the runtime

The notebook will handle all installations and setup automatically once you run the cells.
